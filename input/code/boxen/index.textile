Project 'Boxen' is aiming to be a multi-player first person shooter game involving human characters and vehicles, similar to games of the _Battlefield_ series.

The game's engine is written from scratch in the D programming language. Naturally not all of its wheels are re-invented. Boxen utilizes the *Havok* library for physics, *FMOD* for sound, *OpenGL 3.2* and *CgFX* for graphics and *enet* for a reliable UDP layer. The networking component is based on an "authority scheme":http://gafferongames.com/conferences/migs09/ enabling rich vehicle and kinetic controller dynamics.

The artistic side is covered by my brother, Marcin Stachowiak, who makes awesome low-poly meshes. A gallery of preliminary models can be "viewed here":http://www.dropbox.com/gallery/1267818/1/boxen?h=8e36f1.


h1. Progress

p((. Networked physics on top of *Havok Physics* and new core modules is running fairly well. A simple demo can be "downloaded here":http://bit.ly/c0IlXJ ( { wsad, e, mouse } for controls, only guaranteed to work on Windows with recent GPUs ).

p((. A simple prototype of networked physics and basic gameplay has been successfully constructed and tested with 7 players scattered around the world. The prototype was based on the *PhysX* engine and a very experimental rendering system. I'm currently working on a "new renderer":../nucleus/, which is also the main topic of my MSc thesis. In parallel, I'm replacing the PhysX-based simulation with Havok which has proven to be much more user friendly so far.
