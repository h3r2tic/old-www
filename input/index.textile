Hello, world! I'm a programmer obsessed with gamedev, particularly one of these twisted souls who enjoy engine programming more than working on the actual games.

In my spare time I'm working on a team-based multi-player first person shooter game akin to the _Battlefield_ series. More info "here":code/boxen/.

So far, my largest finished project is "Deadlock":http://deadlock.team0xf.com/, an arena-based multi-player first person shooter done with four friends from "team0xf":http://team0xf.com/.

The progress of my work can be tracked via "my blog":http://h3.gd/devlog/, "twitter":http://twitter.com/h3r2tic/ and a "random stream of images":http://h3.gd/img/ which I sometimes update with cool visuals.

I'm looking for a job in gamedev! Here's "my Résumé":http://bit.ly/hTymRs and a game development reel video:

"Here":code/ is a list containing some of the stuff I've been involved in, and "this page":pub/msc.html contains my MSc thesis about pretty real-time pixels.

Finally, the "about section":about.html contains more info about me and this very website.
