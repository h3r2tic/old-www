h1. Shuriken

Shuriken is my most recent personal graphics research framework. I'm writing it with use of modern OpenGL, and the "Rust":http://www.rust-lang.org/ programming language.

Within the framework I have developed a novel algorithm for rendering real-time reflections, which I call Stochastic Glossy Screen-Space Reflections (SGSSR). It supports moderate and high glossiness levels, as well as normal mapping, all driven by G-Buffer parameters, and consistent with regular lighting. Gaps in the screen-space solution are filled with dynamically re-lit parallax-projected environment maps.

The toy engine also supports a few tiny yet pleasant features:
* Physically-based shading with the Trowbridge-Reitz/GGX specular model;
* Compute-based tiled-deferred lighting;
* Sub-second shader re-loading with automatic dependency tracking;
* A data-driven post-processing pipeline configurable via JSON;
* Alchemy SSAO, FXAA, accumulation-based AA for static shots;
* Glare, tone mapping, chromatic aberration, color grading.
