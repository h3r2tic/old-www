Hello, world! I'm a programmer obsessed with gamedev and the D language. I'm one of these twisted souls who enjoy engine programming more than working on the actual games.

I'm currently working on a team-based multi-player first person shooter game akin to the *Battlefield* series. More info `here <code/boxen/index.html>`__.

So far, my largest finished project is `Deadlock <code/Deadlock.html>`__, an arena-based multi-player first person shooter done with four friends from `team0xf <http://team0xf.com/>`__.

The progress of my work can be tracked via `my blog <http://h3.gd/devlog/>`__, `twitter <http://twitter.com/h3r2tic/>`__ and a `random stream of images <http://h3.gd/img/>`__ which I sometimes update with cool visuals.

`Here <code/index.html>`__ is a list of stuff I've been involved in.

There are references to some interesting projects, portals and smart folks' home pages in the `links <links.html>`__ section.

Finally, the `about <about.html>`__ section contains more info about me and this very website.
