Hello, world! I'm a programmer obsessed with game development, particularly one of these twisted souls who enjoy engine programming more than working on actual games.

I am currently employed as a renderologist at Frostbite.

I sometimes post random screenshots of path-tracers, real-time graphics, and cake on my "twitter":http://twitter.com/h3r2tic/, as well as "here":img/.

"Here":code/ is a list containing some of the stuff I've been involved in, and "this page":pub/msc.html contains my MSc thesis about pretty real-time pixels.

Finally, the "about section":about.html contains more info about me and this very website.
